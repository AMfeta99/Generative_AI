 ### [Diffusion Models Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/diffusion-course/unit0/1) (by Hugging Face)
 - Explore different types of diffusion models, compare with GANs, and understand their strengths and real-world applications.
 - Implement diffusion models using popular frameworks (Diffusers).
 - Building from scratch versus using established methods like DDPM.
 - SOTA techniques for fine-tuning diffusion models, incorporating guidance and conditioning to enhance control and accuracy.
 - Stable Diffusion, focusing on latent diffusion, text conditioning, and tasks (super-resolution, inpainting, and depth-to-image).
 - Explore improvements in training, like faster sampling via distillation.
 - Methods for video and audio generation.
