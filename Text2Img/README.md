# Magic Recipe
[project ideia, still in initial stages]

Walt Disney used to say, 'If you can dream it, you can do it!'
I suggest a slight change to this famous quote: 'If you can describe it, we can do it!ðŸ˜œ' 

This repository aims to experiment with SOTA methods for tex-to-img task. This journey is also a great way to develop skills in popular platforms and tools such as Hugging Face, OpenCV, Diffusers, PyTorch, Prompt Engineering, NLP.
