# GANs-Based Approach 

**Overview**
Generative Adversarial Networks consist of two neural networks: a Generator (G) and a Discriminator (D), which compete against each other in a zero-sum game.



## Repository_files
- models: store  model architectures.
- datasets: Handle data loading and preprocessing.
- utils: Include helper functions (e.g., evaluation metrics, logging).
- train.py:  Train the models and save checkpoints.
- config.py:  Manage hyperparameters and paths.


## Models
- Generator to generate fake data (images, text, etc.).
- Discriminator to distinguish between real and fake data.

## Training Loop
- Train D to maximize the probability of correctly classifying real and fake samples.
- Train G to minimize D's ability to classify fake samples.
- Gradient updates using optimizers like Adam.
- Monitor convergence using metrics like GAN loss and visual inspection.

## Hyperparameters
- Batch size, learning rates for G and D, latent vector size, etc. (config.py).
